A figure leapt from the darkness ahead of them, and only quick reflexes on Castion’s part prevented him from slashing Mortem on the way past them.","\n","^“Goblins!” Mortem snapped. “Wrong cave, run!”","\n","^They scrambled after Mortem as the screeching and scraping of claws on stone closed in. Vague shapes danced at the edge of the flickering circle of light around them, and they stumbled to a halt as Mortem stopped abruptly.","\n","^“What-” Lyria fell silent as she took in the writhing mass of shapes in front of them, around them.","\n","^“It would appear,” Sylvana said grimly, “that we are surrounded.”","\n","^“No way out.” Lyria agreed, eyes flickering around. “We’ll have to fight our way through.”","\n","^“We can’t take this many,” Castion said uncertainly.","\n","^“No choice.” Mortem drew their daggers. “Dead fighting is better than dead standing.”","\n","^Lyria grimaced. “At least we have a minuscule chance this way.”","\n","^It was a lie, and they all knew it.","\n","^<b>PARTY WIPE.</b>","\n","^<b>QUEST FAIL.</b>","\n","ev","str","^<p style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua; color:darkred;\"><b><i>Retry?</i></b></p>","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Beginning"},"end",{"#f":7}]}],{"#f":3}],"Hmm":[["^\"Hmmm...\" Lyria mused, then glanced at Sylvana. \"Think you could do a reading?\"","\n","^The sorceress considered for a moment, then inclined her head. \"It may take a few minutes, however.\"","\n","^Castion waved a hand. \"That's fine; we're not in a huge rush.\"","\n","^\"Didn't you <i>just say</i> that we should be quick with this?\" Mortem wondered.","\n","^\"Technically Lyria said that, I just agreed with her,\" Castion said with a shrug. \"And there's a difference between a ten minute reading and a two-day walk.\"","\n","^\"True enough...\" Mortem shrugged and pulled their hood lower. \"I'm going to do a quick scout around the area while we wait.

Namely that this quest is far more perilous than it first appeared, and that straying from the necessary path with end in grave ruination.\" She took a deep breath. \"<i>Within the peace of deception lies the heart of the rotted wood; remain true to the straight path forward but beware, for the arrogance of hasty carelessness shall spell thy doom; patience opens the way with a clever mind and hidden actions.</i>\"","\n","^\"Well <i>that's</i> not ominous at all,\" Castion deadpanned. \"Any interpretations?\"","\n","^\"<i>Heart of the rotted wood</i> is probably the forest path, so I retract my earlier suggestion.\" Mortem sounded disappointed, likely at the realization that they would be taking the path with no cover.","\n","^\"<i>Hasty carelessness</i> is pretty obvious too,\" Castion mused.","\n","^\"Right, so don't be afraid to rest and take breaks whenever you need too,\" Lyria nodded. \"Makes sense.

Ideas?\"","\n","^\"Take time to make a plan?\" Castion offered.","\n","^\"<i>Hidden actions</i> sounds like sneaking around, which would make sense if we're fighting a <i>dragon</i>.\" Mortem pointed out.","\n","^\"Okay, so,\" Lyria begain, glancing up the mountain. \"Take the straight path up, take breaks as needed, don't throw ourselves into attacks without a plan, make a plan to sneak around the dragon and kill it. Sound about right?\"","\n","^\"Yes,\" Sylvana nodded, having regained some of the color to her face. \"That would be the correct interpretation.\"","\n","^\"Alright, then let's go,\" Castion rose, pulling Lyria and Mortem to their feet.","\n","ev","str","^<p style=\"font-family:Book Antiqua; color:dodgerblue;\"><i>Continue On</i></p>","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"StraightPath2"},"end",{"#f":7}]}],{"#f":3}],"#f":3}],"listDefs":{}};
